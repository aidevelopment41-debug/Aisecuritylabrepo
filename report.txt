AI Security Lab - Data Connection & Progress System Update Report
================================================================

Date: January 27, 2026
Version: 1.1.0
Update Type: Major Enhancement & Bug Fixes

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================
This update successfully resolved critical data connectivity issues in the AI Security Lab and implemented a comprehensive progress tracking system. The lab interface is now fully functional with real-time progress updates, task completion tracking, and achievement rewards.

ISSUES RESOLVED
===============

1. DATA CONNECTION PROBLEMS
---------------------------
Problem: Lab interface components were not properly connecting to backend data sources
- Examples failing to load from Flask backend
- Progress tracking not updating in real-time
- Missing API endpoints causing connection failures

Solution:
- Created missing /api/telemetry endpoint with fallback mock data
- Enhanced error handling in ExampleSelector component
- Fixed API response validation and data parsing
- Added proper environment variable configuration

2. PROGRESS SYSTEM NOT UPDATING
-------------------------------
Problem: Points and progress were not updating when users completed tasks or made attempts
- Only successful injections awarded points (too restrictive)
- No feedback for learning attempts
- Progress bar remained static
- Task completion not properly tracked

Solution:
- Implemented participation-based point system
- Added real-time progress updates across all components
- Created comprehensive achievement system
- Enhanced task grading with better feedback
